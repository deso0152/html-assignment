        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p><strong>It’s all good in the woods.</strong> I love being
            outdoors, especially when I have friends and a camera with me. Even though I love being a <a
                href="https://www.estudiolasso.com/" target="blank"><abbr title="Enter Estudio Lasso Website">product
                    photographer</abbr></a>, I also love
            photographing nature. So much that I even created a website to sell my prints. It is called <a
                href="https://www.alvesfineart.com/" target="blank">Alves Fine Art</a>.
        </p>
        <p>At a first glance, regarding my personality, you might think I’m introverted but don’t be fooled, the more I
            get comfortable with those around me, the more I can get you laughing, by me or of me. I’m always open to
            <em>new experiences</em>, opportunities to meet new people are valuable to me. So what is left to say is, my
            name is Paulo Alves and I`m looking forward to meeting you.
