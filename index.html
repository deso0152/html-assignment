            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p><strong>It’s all good in the woods.</strong> I love being
                outdoors, especially when I have friends and a camera with me. Even though I love being a <a
                    href="https://www.estudiolasso.com/" target="blank"><abbr title="Enter Estudio Lasso Website">product
                        photographer</abbr></a>, I also love photographing nature. So much that I even created a website to sell my prints. It is called <a
                    href="https://www.alvesfineart.com/" target="blank"><abbr title="Enter Alves Fine Art Website">Alves Fine Art</abbr></a>.
            </p>
            <p>At a first glance, regarding my personality, you might think I’m introverted but don’t be fooled, the more I
                get comfortable with those around me, the more I can get you laughing, by me or of me. I’m always open to
                new experiences, opportunities to meet new people are valuable to me. So what is left to say is, my
                name is Paulo Alves and I`m looking forward to meeting you.
            </p>
